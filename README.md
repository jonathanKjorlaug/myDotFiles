### My (public) dotfiles!

This is a (somewhat) up-to-date version of my current dotfiles! Feel free to roast my formatting and other mistakes. As of now, they're based on using the best named dotfiles manager: Toml Bombadil. There's an install script included that's written for Arch Linux (btw) that should work if using arch. To do so, just clone the repo into your home repo, install GNU Stow, and enter the home directory, followed by running

    stow .

There is also an outdated install-script, but I would reccomend against using that for now.

As of writing, I am using wezterm as my terminal emulator, zsh as my shell, neovim as my main* editor, and most importantly of all: Fastfetch to make sure everyone knows I'm using Arch! (Because why else would it exist?!)
