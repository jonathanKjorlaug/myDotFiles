### My (public) dotfiles!

This is a (somewhat) up-to-date version of my current dotfiles! Feel free to roast my formatting and other mistakes. 
As of now, they're based on gnu stow. To use the dotfiles, simply clone the repo into your home directory, install 
GNU Stow (For instance by running `sudo pacman -S stow`), and run the following command


    stow .

There's also a (somewhat outdated) install script included that's written for Arch Linux (btw), though
It's only there to give a rough idea of what to install or do, I wouldn't reccomend actually running it.

As of writing, I am using kitty as my terminal emulator, zsh as my shell, neovim as my main* editor, and most importantly
of all: Fastfetch to make sure everyone knows I'm using Arch! (Because why else would it exist?!)
